Personal project to manage my rent house (financial, tenant, and report) system. 
### Feature :
- Create Tenant and Cost data to Firebase, Read the data
- Export to PDF option
- Manage income and expense (basic operation)
### Notes :
You can download json file included in `json_file` folder to import it to your Firebase project so you won't create the database from the very beginning.
